"""appkit — the tiny local-app framework the practice apps are built on.

Standard library only. No pip, no internet, no build step.

An app is: a folder with `static/` in it, plus routes registered on an App.
Run it and it picks a free port on localhost, serves the GUI, and opens a browser.

    from appkit import App
    app = App("Workflow Mapper", Path(__file__).parent)

    @app.api("GET", "/api/things")
    def list_things(req):
        return {"things": [...]}          # dict/list -> JSON

    app.run()                             # blocking; Ctrl+C to stop

Design rules this file exists to enforce:
  * Bind to loopback by default. These apps hold client data; a network address
    is never the default and never implicit. An app that wants to be reachable
    from a phone must pass `host=` and say out loud that it did -- see
    `phone/app.py`, which requires a flag and a PIN before it will do it.
  * Every API error returns JSON, never an HTML traceback page. The GUI can then
    show a real message instead of silently doing nothing.
  * No caching of app files, so an edit + refresh is the whole dev loop.
